# WorkoutTracker_noSQL

## Purpose
This is a fitness app that allows users to enter in workouts they have performed, either resistance or cardio, and track their progress over a week span. Their inputs are added to a table, but also shown visually with Charts.js, giving the user a visual of their current week of exercise.

## Tech Used
This app was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Charts.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. 

This was a great project where we initially learned Express and Mongo. 
Initially difficult but eventually became one of my favorite little projects learning this technology.
